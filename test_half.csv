These include a British couple, Susan Helen Danford (based on Samantha Lewthwaite[4]) and her husband.

Kenyan special forces are positioned nearby to make the arrest. The mission is supervised in the United Kingdom by a COBRA meeting that includes British Lieutenant General Frank Benson, two full government ministers and a ministerial under-secretary. Powell decides that the imminent bombing changes the mission objective from ""capture"" to ""kill"". To her frustration, her counsel advises her to seek approval from superiors.

After Diaoxian's betrayal led to the Demon King and his followers being turned into demons and sent to Hell as Diaoxian sought to hide his crimes from the other gods; the Demon King sought to take advantage of a date when the realms were close by and reincarnations occurred as his big chance to win redemption for his clan by using the Dark Crystal to expose Diaoxian. One of those was ""Little Snow,"" later known as Snow Girl, a human-demon hybrid able to take on a crystalline ice form and control all things related to cold weather. However, she also discovered that Diaoxian was already indoctrinating Kui, and fled back to Hell heartbroken. He gave a magic elixir to Kui in order to fool Kui into believing he was still fully human and alive, rather than a human-demon hybrid per an unholy resurrection.
